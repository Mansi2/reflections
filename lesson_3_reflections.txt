When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a group project, I would prefer hosting it on github as all my partners can view my work and can update theirs.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we dont want the feature or branch which is not fully developed to interfere with the local repository. It should be merged only after it gains stability ,hence manual pull is required.
